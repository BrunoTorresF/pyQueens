# pyQueens - my N-Queens solution with python3

Here's the programming problem: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle

These are the different aspects of the project you can work on (in order):

1. determine all possible solutions for a given N where N â‰¥ 8 (within 10 mins on a laptop). Bonus points for a higher N where N is the size of the board / number of queens
2. iterate over N and store the solutions in postgres using SQLAlchemy
3. write basic tests that at least verify the number of solutions for a given N match what's online. I recommend using pytest
4. Docker-ize the solution, so that I can run the code and tests without any assumption of my local setup (including running a postgres instance in docker-compose)
5. setup Travis CI (or similar) for your public GitHub repo to run the tests automatically
