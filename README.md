# pyQueens - my N-Queens solution with python3

## Run Instructions

**Requires Docker & Docker Compose**

1. Clone repo: `git clone https://github.com/BrunoTorresF/pyQueens.git`
1. Build containers: `docker-compose up --build -d`
1. Execute main program: `docker-compose run pyqueens`
1. Run tests: `docker-compose run pyqueens_test`
1. Check postgres instance: `docker exec -it postgres psql -U pyqueens -W`
   1. pyqueens role password is: `pyqueens8`

## Problem Context & Instructions

Here's the programming problem: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle

These are the different aspects of the project you can work on (in order):

- [x] 1. determine all possible solutions for a given N where N â‰¥ 8 (within 10 mins on a laptop). Bonus points for a higher N where N is the size of the board / number of queens
- [x] 2. iterate over N and store the solutions in postgres using SQLAlchemy
- [x] 3. write basic tests that at least verify the number of solutions for a given N match what's online. I recommend using pytest
- [x] 4. Docker-ize the solution, so that I can run the code and tests without any assumption of my local setup (including running a postgres instance in docker-compose)
- [x] 5. setup Travis CI (or similar) for your public GitHub repo to run the tests automatically
